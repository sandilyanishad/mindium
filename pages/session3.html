        <p><b>What is Rational Emotive & Congnitive Behavioral Therapy?</b><br><br>
        Rational-Emotive & Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was founded by psychologist Dr. Albert Ellis, in 1955 in New York, USA.
        It is the first Cognitive Behavioral approach which is an effective, evidence-based psychotherapy in dealing with a wide variety of emotional and behavioral difficulties. <br></br><b>Why choose such a therapy?</b><br><br>Our RECBT therapists will show you a useful way for managing your emotions and your behaviors. More specifically, the RECBT therapist will help you to locate and challenge your irrational (non-helpful) beliefs. Identifying and challenging non-helpful core beliefs will help you to feel and act better without being totally influenced from events around you. <br><br><b>Will this therapy work for me? </b><br><br>Success in therapy is very depended on the therapistâ€™s skill, but also on your own active role in therapeutic process. Therefore it is important to accept the basic principles of Rational-Emotive & Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and to participate actively and cooperate with the therapeutic process and therapist. Your therapist will give you guidelines for the therapeutic work and when you are actively engaged, you will be gradually be in the position of managing your issues significantly better and more effectively. <br><br><b>Still doubt it? </b><br><br>You can go back to our services and book a free trial.
