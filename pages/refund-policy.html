            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><b>Refund Policy</b></h2><p>Effective date: 2021-02-21, <b>Last Updated: 2021-02-25</b></p>
            <p>Thank you for choosing mindium and purchasing an online therapy session. We hope that you are content with your purchase. However, in case you aren't for any reason, you may contact us for a refund. Please see below to find out more about our refunds policy.</p>
            <p>1. <b>Refund Process</b><br> <br>To ask for a refund, you will have to contact us via our <b>Contact us</b> page in the main menu of mindium. Please note that, only partial refunds will be provided which will be half the initial amount paid to mindium in the time of booking a session. Customers are needed to ask for a partial refund 2 days prior to the date of the session.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Exceptions</b> <br> <br> In case of refund request made by the customer a day before the session (this doesnot apply to bookings done within t-2th day) or on the day of the session, the refund won't be made. This is done to safeguard mindium's service to customers as well as the therapists. </p>

                The payments section is handled by Razorpay. After a successful refund initiation by mindium, the customer will get a confirmation email by Razorpay.
