        <p><b>What is Counselling?</b><br><br>
            Counseling is the means by which one person helps another through purposeful conversation. Counselling is a process in which two people meet to explore personal problems and to identify solutions. Counseling is a process through which one person helps another by purposeful conversation in an understanding atmosphere. It seeks to establish a helping relationship in which the one counseled can express their thoughts and feelings in such a way as to clarify their own situation, come to terms with some new experience, see their difficulty more objectively, and so face their problem with less anxiety and tension. <br></br><b>Why choose Counselling?</b><br><br>Counselling people often means coping with emotion. Once people in counseling begin to identify the real issues, they often begin to experience emotional release. A considerable process part of the process of helping people in counseling is concerned with the emotional or 'feelings 'side of the person.
